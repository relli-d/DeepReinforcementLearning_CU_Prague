# DeepReinforcementLearning_CU_Prague
## Course Description
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments from [NPFL139 – Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/npfl139/2425-summer), a course taught by professor [Milan Straka](https://github.com/foxik) at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University (Prague).
The course provides a hands-on exploration of deep reinforcement learning, combining theoretical foundations with practical implementation of modern RL algorithms in Python and PyTorch. Throughout the semester, students build agents capable of solving control tasks, playing video games from pixels, mastering complex board games with planning, and tackling continuous-action robotics environments.

The assignments are structured weekly and include competitive tasks where students aim to achieve the best performance in the class. This repository documents my progression through these tasks, covering classical RL, value-based deep methods, policy-gradient methods, distributional RL, continuous control, multi-agent RL, and AlphaZero-style planning.
